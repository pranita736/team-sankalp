                        Sankalp is one of the good learning platforms.
                        I learned many things in Sankalp. It provided the
                        greatest area for learning Aptitude, Coding,
                        Personality Skills developments, etc.
                        The google meet sessions which were held
                        by Sankalp was one of the best useful things during the
                        pandemic. Sankalp is also the best platform where
                        we can share our ideas, works, and achievements, etc
                        and also we can see other's works also.It is the
                        best platform to build your career with peers.
                        It will motivate you in every aspect. It has motivated me.

                        When I joined the Sankalp team,
                        I was curious about it. Then there
                        were some session like Speak to lead,
                        which was an interactive session I was
                        enjoying it. One more session Technophilia
                        which was good, and I gained some knowledge
                        about coding, And last but not least aptitude
                        questions were there from which I learned a lot.
                        The seniors of the team were so friendly, and
                        they were so helpful. Thank you, team Sankalp
                        for making my learning more interesting.
